# Hi! I'm Subham Kumar🙏  
### 🔌 Embedded Systems & IoT Engineer

I work where **hardware meets firmware** — building embedded systems that are meant to run on real boards, under real constraints, not just in simulations.

I care about **low-level control, deterministic behavior, and clean system design**.


## 🧰 Tech Stack

### 💻 Programming
- 🧠 **C (Embedded C)**  
- ⚙️ **C++**  
- 🐍 **Python** (tooling, automation)  
- 🐜 **MicroPython**

### 🔩 Microcontrollers & Platforms
- 📟 **ESP32 / ESP8266**
- 🔌 **Arduino (ATmega328P)**
- 🧠 **STM32 (ARM Cortex-M)**

### 🧩 Embedded Concepts
- 🧱 Bare-metal programming  
- 📟 Register-level coding  
- ⏱ Timers, PWM, interrupts  
- 🔄 UART, SPI, I²C, I²S  
- 🧵 RTOS fundamentals (tasks, queues, semaphores)  
- 💾 Memory management in constrained systems  

### 🔧 Hardware & Design
- 🔋 Basic Electronics (Analog + Digital)  
- ⚡ Power supplies & signal conditioning  
- 🖥 PCB Design with **KiCad**  
- 📡 Sensor interfacing & debugging  

### ☁️ IoT & Systems
- 📡 MQTT, HTTP, REST APIs  
- ☁️ Cloud-connected embedded devices  
- 🧠 Edge-side data acquisition & control  

## 🚀 Current Focus

- 📌 Embedded C + **DSA for embedded systems**
- 🔍 ESP32 deep dive (peripherals, drivers, performance)
- 🧵 RTOS-based firmware architecture
- 🛠 From prototype-level code to **production-ready systems**
- 🧾 Improving PCB reliability & hardware design practices

## 🎯 Engineering Philosophy

- ✅ Correctness over shortcuts  
- ⏱ Determinism over clever tricks  
- 🔍 Understand **why** before **how**  
- 🧱 Firmware should survive real hardware, noise, and failure cases
